# TurretWhacker
Adjusts the behavior of hitting turrets with shovels and signs.

## Features
Hitting a turret will now do one of the following, with configurable probabilities:
- Success [80%] - Temporarily disable the turret for a short period of time, as if disabled by the terminal.
- Critical Success [1%] - Permanently disable the turret.
- No Effect [10%] - Do nothing at all.
- Standard [9%] - Trigger the vanilla behavior of spinning around and shooting.

## Compatibility
- **Unlikely** to be compatible with mods that affect the behavior of hitting turrets.
- *Might* be compatible with mods that add additional turrets, untested.
- *Might* have compatibility issues with mods that change how the terminal functions.
