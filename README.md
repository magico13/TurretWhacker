# TurretWhacker
Lethal Company mod that adjusts the behavior of hitting turrets with shovels and signs.

## Features
Hitting a turret will now do one of the following, with configurable [default] probabilities:
- [80%] Temporarily disable the turret for a short period of time, as if disabled by the terminal.
- [1%] Permanently disable the turret.
- [10%] Do nothing at all.
- [9%] Trigger the vanilla behavior of shooting while spinning.
